       <h1 class="header">How Does The Algorithm Work?</h1> 
       <p>
           This algorithm uses a stack to verify matching brackets. When an opening bracket is seen, it is added to the stack.
           When a closing bracket is seen, the algorithm checks whether the top of the stack contains the matching opening
           bracket. If the brackets match, then then the algorithm pops the opening bracket off of the stack. If the bracket does not match
           then the algorithm returns false. if the algorithm reaches the end of the brackets without returning false, the length of the stack 
           is checked. If the stack is empty, this means that every opening bracket had a matching closing bracket. If the stack is not empty, 
           this means that there was an opening bracket with no matching closing bracket.
       </p>
       <h1 class="header">When is true returned?</h1>
       <p>True is returned when each opening bracket has a matching closing bracket and vice versa</p>
       <h1 class="header">When is false returned?</h1>
       <p>There are two cases that return false: 
            <br>
            <br>Case 1: A closing bracket is reached and the top of the stack does not contain the matching opening bracket
            <br>
            <br>Case 2: An opening bracket does not have a matching closing bracket. In this case, the algorithm will reach the point
            where the length of the stack is checked. Due to the opening bracket having no closing bracket, it will remain on the stack 
            and the length of the stack will be greater than 0, resulting in the algorithm returning false.
            <br>
            <br>Note: brackets of different types are not considered matching brackets. For example, the pair of brackets '(]', although they are 
            opening and closing, they are not considered matching because they are different types of brackets.
